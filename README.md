# Accounting

With access to an accounting database, we need to build queries by way of a Stored Procedure 
to create the Profit and Loss (P/L) and Balance Sheet (B/S) statements for any given year. 

The SP can execute for any year based on data availability. 
The output is displayed as a temp table on the result grid. 
Financial metrics and ratios are also calculated and displayed.
